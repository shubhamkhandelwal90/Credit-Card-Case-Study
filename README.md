# Credit-Card-Case-Study
This Credit Card case study aims to give us an idea of applying EDA in a real  business scenario. In this case study, we develop a basic  understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services  and understand how data is used to minimize the risk of losing  money while lending to customers.
